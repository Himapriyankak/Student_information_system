# Student_information_system
Developed a Student Information System using Java technologies (JDBC, Servlets, JSP) following the MVC design pattern. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for Admin  login, data entry, storage in a JDBC database, and display of Student details in a Table format.
Key Features:

Login Page:
Create a simple login page for Admins to enter their credentials (e.g., username and password).
Implement authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
Student Details Form (JSP):
Design a JSP page with a form to capture student details, including fields such as Id,Name,Course.
Servlets (Controller):
Implement a servlet acting as the controller to handle requests from the JSP pages.
Use the servlet to process login requests, validate user credentials.
DAO Layer (Data Access Object):
Develop a DAO layer to interact with the database.
Include methods to insert student details into the database and retrieve student information for display.
JDBC Database:
Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store student information.
Create a table to store student details with appropriate columns (e.g., ID, Name, Course).
Insertion of Student Details:
Upon form submission, use the servlet to capture the entered data.
Call the DAO layer to insert the student details into the database.
Display Students in Grid Format (JSP):
Create a JSP page to display student information in a grid format.
Retrieve data from
MVC Design Pattern:
Follow the MVC design pattern with clear separation of concerns.
Model: Represent the student data structure and database interactions in the DAO layer.
View: Use JSP pages for the user interface.
Controller: Implement servlets to manage the flow of data between the view and the model.
Exception Handling:
Implement proper exception handling throughout the application to manage errors gracefully.
This Student Information System project will provide a hands-on experience in building a web application using Java technologies and the MVC design pattern.
